# DeliverySchedule

This applications takes a .csv file of packages 
and a .csv file of delivery addresses, and uses
a nearest neighbor algorithm to schedule the delivery 
of the packages by three trucks. 

The goal is to optimize delivery of the packages 
to result in the fewest total number of miles 
traveled by the trucks. 

There are a few constraints. Some packages have 
to be delivered by a certain deadline, some aren't 
available to deliver until later, and one has its 
delivery address changed mid-morning. 

I developed my own hashmap from scratch in order to 
more thoroughly understand how a hashmap works. 

This application is written is python.
